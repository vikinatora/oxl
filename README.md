## Introduction
### Oxl SPA web app is a project as a mandatory exam requirement for the course "Angular Fundamentals March 2019" by SoftUni.
## Description
Oxl is a simple trading Single-page application written in **Angular** and **Node.js** where users can post items that they no longer need and other users can contact them if they want to purchase their item. There are 2 main user roles - **normal user** and **one admin** that is created when the server is started. **Signed in users** can access the page with all the offers and create their own. They can **view their profile** and manage their offers - **mark them as purchased** so that they don't appear on the main offer page, **edit** or **delete** them. Users also can **search offers based on their name and/or category**. The admin can create categories which will be used by users to associate the offer with it. The admin can also **delete any offer** which he doesn't find suitable for the website.
