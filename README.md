## Introduction
### Oxl SPA web app is a project as a mandatory exam requirement for the course "Angular Fundamentals March 2019" by SoftUni.
## Description
Oxl is a simple trading Single-page application written in **Angular** and **Node.js** where users can post items that they no longer need and other users can contact them if they want to purchase their item. There are 2 main user roles - **normal user** and **one admin** that is created when the server is started. Signed in users can access the page with all the offers and create their own. They can view their profile and manage their offers - mark them as purchased so that they don't appear on the main offer page, edit or delete them. Users also can search offers based on their name and/or category. The admin can create categories which will be used by users to associate the offer with it. The admin can also delete any offer which he doesn't find suitable.
